# DeepSesh
### The Productivity Tool of Professional Extroverts

### What is DeepSesh?
A platform to syncronise schedules with nearby coworkers.

Sessions often split into two intervals:
**Focus**
You work on your own projects.
**Break**
Move, Network, Brainstorm and Banter.

Syncronised focus creates social accountability to minimise distraction and elevate productivity.

Syncronised breaks create space to build community and socialise without interrupting.

The blend allows people to be both productive and connected.
